# Changelog

## 0.2.5 - 2026-02-07

- Added language-agnostic release asset tooling: `manifest.json` builder, optional `jp_idwr_db.duckdb`, and `jp-idwr-db-build-assets` CLI.
- Updated release automation to publish parquet tables with `manifest.json` (and DuckDB artifact) as first-class release assets.
- Updated runtime data download to consume `manifest.json` assets, with automatic fallback to legacy `jp_idwr_db-manifest.json` + zip releases.
- Expanded README language-independent usage docs and clarified that pre-`v0.2.5` releases use legacy asset format.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-02-07

- Fixed sentinel (`teitenrui`) `count` values by converting cumulative year-to-date reports into weekly incidence.
- Regenerated `sentinel.parquet` and `unified.parquet` from corrected weekly counts.
- Added tests for cumulative-to-weekly conversion and documented the sentinel counting convention.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-02-06

- Refreshed release data assets from sorted parquet datasets (date/prefecture/category ordering).
- Improved README motivation and practical example narrative.
- Expanded examples with research-oriented `get_data()` workflows.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-02-06

- Fixed PyPI publish command in release workflow for current `uv` (`uv publish dist/*`).

## 0.2.1 - 2026-02-06

- Fixed release workflow validation issue and simplified current publish path to PyPI token-based mode.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-02-06

- Switched packaged data delivery to GitHub Release assets with runtime caching.
- Added checksum-verified data manager and CLI prefetch (`python -m jp_idwr_db data download`).
- Removed parquet payload from wheels and added release asset build/publish workflow.
- Added CI smoke checks for wheel install/runtime data loading and data-manager tests.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-02-06

- First public release under the new package name `jp-idwr-db`.
- Independent data-engineering scope (inspired by `jpinfect`, not API parity).
- Historical + modern IDWR ingestion, including sentinel (`teitenrui`) archives from 2012+.
- Bundled parquet datasets (`sex`, `place`, `bullet`, `sentinel`, `unified`) and Polars-first API.
